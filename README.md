# Description
This project simplifies complicated circuits into simpler ones using basic circuit rules.

# Assumptions
The input circuits for simplification.nb assume that the only components in the circuit are:
- DC
- Resistors
- Constant voltage
- Constant current
- Configured in series and parallel

Thevinin and Norton transitions are performed only after simplifying complex circuits.
